Using PHP, this will look for the method in the HTTP request and do the CRUD request accordingly.   

This code might need to be changed slightly since return doesn't seem to work but the echo does. I do not have much time to look it over and play with it at the moment, but will get back to it eventually. I will more than likely make an Express/JS version of this soon to connect with a MySQL database.
